# This script is used to map the screen to the Corsair RGB keyboard. 
# It uses the Corsair SDK to control the RGB lighting on the keyboard based on the screen content. 
# The script takes a screenshot of the screen and maps the pixel colors to the corresponding keys on the keyboard. 
# The RGB lighting on the keyboard is updated based on the pixel colors from the screen. 
# The script continuously updates the RGB lighting on the keyboard to mirror the screen content. 
# The script can be stopped by pressing Ctrl+C.
